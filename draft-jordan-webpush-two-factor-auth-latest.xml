This document defines a protocol to challenge a user to prove that
they have a device in their possession (i.e. provide second-factor
authentication). This scheme builds upon WebPush.</t>

<section title="Introduction">
<t>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
this document are to be interpreted as described in
<xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
This document is being discussed on the xyz@example.org mailing list.
</t>
<t>
Passwords have for some time been known to the security community to
be insufficient for authenticating users. Passwords are vulnerable to
brute-force attacks unless servers properly implement rate limiting,
which can be difficult to do correctly. Unless required to choose
otherwise, users also tend to pick easily guessed passwords or even
trivial passwords such as the literal word "password". Moreover, these
problems are worsened by the fact that users tend to reuse passwords
across sites which means that if one site improperly stores passwords
and gets compromised, the attacker is likely to now have valid
credentials to other, higher-profile sites.
</t>
<t>
To provide more security in addition to passwords, many systems have
introduced two-factor authentication schemes. Two-factor
authentication systems, sometimes referred to as "second-factor
authentication", require that the user not only prove that they
<spanx>know something</spanx> (i.e. a password), but also that they
<spanx>possess</spanx> something (e.g. a mobile device).
</t>
<t>
Two-factor authentication has historically been implemented using 3 methods:
<list style="numbers">
  <t>HOTP, as specified in <xref target="RFC4226"/></t>
  <t>TOTP, as specified in <xref target="RFC6238"/></t>
  <t>Authentication codes sent over SMS or sometimes email</t>
</list>
All of these systems require the user to manually open an app to
provide an authentication code which is error-prone and inconvenient,
making it harder to encourage two-factor authentication. Note also
that SMS-based systems are not <spanx>true</spanx> two-factor
authentication, as they prove that the user can <spanx>receive some
information</spanx>, not that they possess the device that information
would ordinarily go to - making these systems vulnerable to additional
attacks.
</t>
<t>
This situation can be improved by utilizing <xref
target="RFC8030"/>. In such a model, the user is not required to
retrieve anything; instead, the device that is to be proved to be in
their possession receives a push message that proactively prompts the
user to confirm a login attempt. If the user confirms the legitimacy
of the login, the device submits a cryptographically signed response
to the server affirming the result. This has an additional useful
property in that a server compromise does not lead to the user's
credentials being leaked as it does in TOTP-based systems, since the
server is only required to store the public component of the keypair
on the user's device.
